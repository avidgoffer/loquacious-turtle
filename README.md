Nothing special is needed to run this app.  It does have a gradle dependcy for a disk caching solution I found.

I was unable to get the tests to work right.  I've done TDD in other environments such as .NET so I understand the concepts, but everytime I tried run tests, tests that should fail were passing.  I'm going to keep looking into this to try and see what I am missing.

If you have any questions regarding the app please contact me.
